      <h2>Hi! My name is Kelly.</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in the post-baccalaureate Computer Science program at Oregon State University. 
        I'm also an operating room registered nurse, and I've spent the last 3 years working as a travel nurse in various cities across the United States. 
        My husband is also a travel OR nurse, and together (along with our two cats) we've 
        embarked on numerous cross-country trips. Through these experiences, we've gained valuable insights into planning and executing successful road trips. I've developed this app to help you plan your next adventure. I hope you find it useful!
